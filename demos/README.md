# The demos folder
Here you will find examples on gif and image formats, as well as the PDFs I used for creating the tutorials and doing some testing. 

This file is also an step by step guide to analyze the three demos you can find in this folder to help you get used to this application.

# Analyzing 'demo_no_jumps.pdf'
This file is the most simple case for analyzing as it will not require eliminating any images and it have a pattern of 1 as every page has a different content but with the same layout.

Click on 'Choose a PDF' to select the file, then on 'Delete Pages'. As said before, we want to keep all the pages in this PDF so we will leave the field where we were supossed to introduce the pages indexes in blank and just click on 'ok'. Clicking in 'PDF to images' will ask to introduce a name for a folder were we will save the pages as images, for this tutorial it will be named as the file, 'demo_no_jumps' (which you can also find in this folder). If done correctly 'demo_no_jumps' should contain three images that correspond to three pages of the PDF. 

Now that we have the images we can click on 'Extract Information' to start the selection process. First select the folder where the images were saved by clicking on 'Load images'. Once the folder have been selected a new window will appear. Here we need to introduce the pattern that the PDF follows and if we want to see a randomized selection of the pages or see them in order. Because our PDF has every page the same layout and each page correspond to the information of a different client we know that the pattern is 1. The randomized option must be filled but whatever we choose it will not affect the PDF or the order in which the information is extracted, just the images we see.

After clicking on 'ok' you are ready to start selecting everything you need and whenever you finish you can click on 'Extract text' to export each field into an xlsx file.
